## Code review

This README will show what to check during the code review process.
The scripts contain examples of how the analyses was done and the generated figures. 
Some of the scripts may redirect to other used functions which the reviewer might need to take a look at.

<<<<<<< HEAD
* The model classes are implemented here through [SEIV_diff_NE](./../src/models/SEIV_diff_NE.m) and used ordinary differential equations, given by [ode_funs](./../src/models/ode_funs.m)
* The other functions used in the script (which do not need review) are, [inferece_script](./../inference_script.m), [find_confidence_intervals](./../tools/find_confidence_interval_looped.m) and [get_dirstr](./../src/get_dirstr.m)

### ROADMAP: One step inference
Take a look at the [one_step_inference_examples](one_step_inference_examples.m) script to begin with, shown for one of the pairs of host and phage.
The script used the functions:

* [one_step_simulate](./../src/one-step-src/one_step_simulate.m) -- this further uses.
* [one_step_before_dilution](./../src/one-step-src/one_step_eqn_before_dilution.m) -- THIS FUNCTION CONTAINS THE DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS -- CHECK WITH SUPPLEMENTATY INFO PART S1.1 MODEL A.

### ROADMAP: Community inference.
Next, read [community_inference_SEIVD](./community_inference_SEIVD.m) -- this has both has SEIVD and SEIV.
* The model classes are implemented here through [SEIV_diff_NE](./../src/models/SEIV_diff_NE.m) and used ordinary differential equations, given by [ode_funs](./../src/models/ode_funs.m) -- please compare them against the equations given in the appendix
* The other functions used in the script (which do not need review) are, [inferece_script](./../inference_script.m), [find_confidence_intervals](./../tools/find_confidence_interval_looped.m) and [get_dirstr](./../src/get_dirstr.m)

The models are.

### Figures from paper:
* Figure 1 -- one model example was already shown in one-step-inference. The figures can be generated using, [fig1_parameters.m](./../scripts/scripts_for_figures/figure1/fig1_parameters.m)
* Figure 2 -- this one takes 10 mins -- [figure2](./../scripts/scripts_for_figures/figure2/figure2.m)
* Figure 3 -- already shown how the inference process works in [community_inference_SEIVD](./community_inference_SEIVD.m)-- final figure generated by [fig3_condifence.m](./../scripts/scripts_for_figures/figure3/fig3_condifence.m)
* Figure 4 -- already shown how the inference process works in [community_inference_SEIVD](./community_inference_SEIVD.m)-- final figure generated by [fig4_condifence.m](./../scripts/scripts_for_figures/figure4/fig4_condifence.m)
* Figure 5 -- collection of all the parameters -- plotted from stored datasets -- using [life_history_compare_new](./../scripts/scripts_for_figures/figure5/life_history_compare_new.m)

### Supplementary Information
 Next, look at the examples of how the supplementary figures were generated at [supple_post_processing](./supple_post_processing.m)
The figures are generated using the following scripts.
* [debris_plot](./../tools/debris_plot.m)
* [CV_NE](./../tools/CV_NE.m)
* [gelman2](./../tools/gelman2.m)
* [trace_plots_compare_V2](./../tools/trace_plots_compare_V2.m)
* [AIC_plot](./../tools/AIC_plot.m)
