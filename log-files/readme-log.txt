1. Submitted broader priors of burst sizes to PACE 
To DO

2. Perform sensitivity analysis for only beta, then for only tau -- submit this to github.
3. Perform conditional sampling of posterior, only beta and only tau.
4. My own MH method for gaussian priors -- just do GD and then do MH to see where it lands. -- Then do GR and geweke.
