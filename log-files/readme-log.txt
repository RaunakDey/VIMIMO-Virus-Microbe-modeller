1. Submitted broader priors of burst sizes to PACE 
To DO

2. Perform sensitivity analysis for only beta, then for only tau -- submit this to github.
3. Perform conditional sampling of posterior, only beta and only tau.
4. My own MH method for gaussian priors -- just do GD and then do MH to see where it lands. -- Then do GR and geweke.
5.


Strategies -- discussed with Steve 
1. Run inferences on less parameters -- that way broader distributions -- done for beta -- do for tau
-- later replot the simulations and cut it at 95% -- (inaccurate) --
95% of the log-likelihood.

2. Need to include sigma -- sigma too large solution will definitely overshoot data. 
Sigma very small -- solution will undershoot data.
